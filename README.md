# printf
I recoded a part of the the libcâ€™s printf function.

## Getting started
Run make and to get libftprint.a and then compile it with your source file.
```
gcc main.c libftprintf.a
```

## Functionality

SPECIFIER         OUTPUT                                    EXAMPLE
d or i            Signed decimal integer                    392
u                 Unsigned decimal integer                  7235
o                 Unsigned octal                            610
x                 Unsigned hexadecimal integer              7fa
X                 Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)  7FA
f                 Decimal floating point, lowercase         392.65
F                 Decimal floating point, uppercase         392.65
```
### Flags
```
FLAGS   DESCRIPTION
-       Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default (see width sub-specifier).
+       Forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers. By default, only negative           numbers are preceded with a - sign.
(space) If no sign is going to be written, a blank space is inserted before the value.
#       Used with o, x or X specifiers the value is preceeded with 0, 0x or 0X respectively for values different than zero.
0       Left-pads the number with zeroes (0) instead of spaces when padding is specified (see width sub-specifier).
```
### Width
```
WIDTH       DESCRIPTION
(number)    Minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value to be printed is shorter than this number, the result is
            padded with blank spaces. The value is not truncated even if the result is larger.
*           The width is not specified in the format string, but as an additional integer value argument preceding the
            argument that has to be formatted.
